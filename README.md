# My Portfolio

Welcome!

Please see below for the list of projects included in this repository. For Jupyter Notebooks I recommend to view the notebooks on nvviewer to avoid rendering issues (through the links provided below) but also feel free to find the notebooks and source codes on this repo.

For more information about me, my resume and some testimonial please visit my personal website at [www.arash-tavassoli.com](www.arash-tavassoli.com).
